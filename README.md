# nim-claude

This is a web-based Nim game generated by Claude Code.

The prompts used to generate it were the following:

"Create a web-based Nim game with columns containing 3, 5, and 7 items.
Allow a human to play against the computer.
Allow the human to choose which player makes the first move.
The computer player should use the strategy described at
https://wild.maths.org/play-win-nim to make its moves."

This generated a good version of the game in a single, index.html file.

"When it was the computers turn and the remaining items were
1, 2, and 1, the computer made the wrong move. It removed
2 items from the second column which allowed the human to win.
It should have removed only one item from the second column."

"Add the code for this app to the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/mvolkmann/nim-claude."

"Alphabetize the CSS rules based on their first letter character."

"Format the code using Prettier."

"Lint the code using oxlint and fix all errors."

No errors or warnings were generated by oxlint, so no changes were needed.

"Change the way that the human player indicates the items to be removed
so instead of entering a number for a specific column and
clicking a "Remove Items" button, the player clicks one of the green circles
to remove that item and all the items to its right."

"Simplify the UI by removing the text that gives the
column numbers and the number of items remaining. Instead,
just show the green circles remaining in each column."

"Remove the gray panels around each column of green circles."

"In the updateGameStatus function, instead of creating a new span element
by setting the innerHTML of the parent element,
update the class attribute and textContent of the existing span element."

"Currently the code uses the methods getElementById and querySelector
repeatedly to find elements that need to be updated.
Change this to find all those elements at the beginning and
save them in variables so the search for them is only performed once."

"It seems that the gameState property humanFirst is set, but never used.
If that property isn't needed, remove it."

"In the CSS properties, prefer rem units over px units.
Use values that are multiples of 0.5."

"Alphabetize the properties within each CSS rule."

"It seems that the div elements with class="column" are not needed
because the div elements with class="items" hold all the items.
Remove the unnecessary div elements."

'Instead of using the gameState property "currentPlayer"
with a string value of "human" or "computer",
use the gameState property "computerMove" with a Boolean value.'

"Alphabetize the function definitions."

"Currently the updateDisplay function blows away all the div elements inside
itemsContainer and creates new ones from scratch every time it is called.
This is inefficient. Instead just remove the items selected in the last move
and update the remaining div elements as needed."
