# nim-claude

This is a web-based Nim game generated by Claude Code.

The prompts used to generate it were the following:

"Create a web-based Nim game with columns containing 3, 5, and 7 items.
Allow a human to play against the computer.
Allow the human to choose which player makes the first move.
The computer player should use the strategy described at
https://wild.maths.org/play-win-nim to make its moves."

This generated a good version of the game in a single, index.html file.

"When it was the computers turn and the remaining items were
1, 2, and 1, the computer made the wrong move. It removed
2 items from the second column which allowed the human to win.
It should have removed only one item from the second column."

"Add the code for this app to the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/mvolkmann/nim-claude."

"Alphabetize the CSS rules based on their first letter character."

"Format the code using Prettier."

"Lint the code using oxlint and fix all errors."

No errors or warnings were generated by oxlint, so no changes were needed.

"Change the way that the human player indicates the items to be removed
so instead of entering a number for a specific column and
clicking a "Remove Items" button, the player clicks one of the green circles
to remove that item and all the items to its right."

"Simplify the UI by removing the text that gives the
column numbers and the number of items remaining. Instead,
just show the green circles remaining in each column."

"Remove the gray panels around each column of green circles."
