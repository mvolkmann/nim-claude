# nim-claude

This is a web-based Nim game generated by Claude Code.

The prompts used to generate it were the following:

"Create a web-based Nim game with columns containing 3, 5, and 7 items.
Allow a human to play against the computer.
Allow the human to choose which player makes the first move.
The computer player should use the strategy described at
https://wild.maths.org/play-win-nim to make its moves."

This generated a good version of the game in a single, index.html file.

"When it was the computers turn and the remaining items were
1, 2, and 1, the computer made the wrong move. It removed
2 items from the second column which allowed the human to win.
It should have removed only one item from the second column."

"Add the code for this app to the GitHub repository at
https://github.com/mvolkmann/nim-claude."
